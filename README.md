# GBEmu
This is a basic Gameboy emulator. Sound is not implemented at all, and some MBCs are not finished.

Requires SDL2 and PortAudio to compile, probably only works on Windows (with MinGW) and Linux.

Use the provided makefile to compile, to run either directly run the emulator.out file or the run.py file (requires python 3) with the name of the rom (without directory or extension) as the only argument.
